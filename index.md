    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2026/1/7</p>
    <p>Welcome to Daily Signal (the “App”). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your information. This Privacy Policy explains what information may be processed, how it is used, and what choices you have.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The App itself <strong>does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information that directly identifies you</strong>, such as your name, email address, or phone number. No user account is required.</p>
    <p>To support the App's free operation, it integrates Google AdMob for advertising. AdMob, as a third-party service, <strong>may automatically collect and process certain non-personal information</strong> for ad purposes, which may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers</strong> (such as Apple's IDFA or Google's Advertising ID).</li>
        <li>General device information (device model, operating system version, language).</li>
        <li>Approximate location (derived from IP address, not precise GPS).</li>
        <li>Interaction data with ads (e.g., clicks, impressions).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This data may be used for tracking purposes across different apps and websites over time to deliver personalized advertising.</strong> We do not have access to the specifics of the data collected by AdMob.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services & Tracking</h2>
    <p>This App integrates Google AdMob advertising services. Please review Google's Privacy Policy for details:</p>
    <p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></p>
    <p>You can manage your Google ad personalization settings at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank">https://adssettings.google.com</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>App Tracking Transparency:</strong> On iOS/iPadOS devices, the App will request your permission via the system's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework to access the device's advertising identifier for tracking purposes. You can change this permission at any time in your device Settings.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We rely on industry-standard practices and the security measures of our third-party partners to protect data. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided information, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Controls and Choices</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use your device settings to reset your advertising identifier.</li>
        <li>Use your device or Google's settings to opt out of personalized ads.</li>
        <li>On iOS/iPadOS, manage tracking permissions in Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Privacy Policy Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy occasionally. The updated version will be indicated by the revised “Effective Date” at the top of this page.</p>
