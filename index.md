# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2026/01/07

Welcome to **Daily Signal** (the “App”).  
We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your information.  
This Privacy Policy explains what information may be processed, how it is used, and what choices you have.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

The App itself **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information that directly identifies you**, such as your name, email address, or phone number.  
No user account is required.

To support the App's free operation, it integrates **Google AdMob** for advertising.  
AdMob, as a third-party service, **may automatically collect and process certain non-personal information** for ad purposes, which may include:

- **Advertising Identifiers** (such as Apple's IDFA or Google's Advertising ID)
- General device information (device model, operating system version, language)
- Approximate location (derived from IP address, not precise GPS)
- Interaction data with ads (e.g., clicks, impressions)

**This data may be used for tracking purposes across different apps and websites over time to deliver personalized advertising.**  
We do not have access to the specifics of the data collected by AdMob.

## 3. Data Security
