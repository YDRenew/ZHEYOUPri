        <li>Approximate location (inferred from IP address, not precise GPS).</li>
        <li>Interaction data with ads (e.g., clicks, impressions).</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>This data may be used for tracking purposes across different apps and websites over time to deliver personalized advertising.</strong> We do not have access to the specifics of this data collected by AdMob.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>App Tracking Transparency</strong>: On iOS/iPadOS devices, you will be asked for your permission to allow tracking when you first launch the App. You can change this choice at any time in your device's Settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Reset Advertising Identifier</strong>: You can reset your device's advertising identifier in your system settings, which will start a new, non-linked identifier for ad purposes.</li>
    </ul>
